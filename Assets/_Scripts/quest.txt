Quest 1)

I think I need titanium beams to reinforce the tower. Maybe I should check out that structure northeast of the base.

Quest 2)

I've been making good progress with the signal tower. The body is almost done but I'll need to find an antennae to attach in order to make it work. If only I could find a way in the maze...

Quest 3)

The signal tower is almost done. I just need to figure a way to power it. If only I knew how the floating island powers itself to float above ground. There got to be a way to climb on it.
